    "To get a better accuracy of the position of the robot, a Markov Localisation Filter is used. It is based on the Bayes Filter.\n",
    "The Markov process consists of a sequence of states, where each future state only depends on the current state.\n",
    "Markov Localization is particularly useful in scenarios where the environment is partially observable, and there is uncertainty in both the robot's actions and sensor measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtering is done after each segment of the global path that the robot has driven\n",

    "Input: \n",
    "- belief position of the robot based on the global path (x_robot,y_robot)\n",
    "- position of the robot given by CV (x_CV,y_CV)\n",
    "- confidence of the robot's position given by CV\n",
