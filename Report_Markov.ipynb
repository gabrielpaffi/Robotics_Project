    "To get a better accuracy of the position of the robot, a Markov Localisation Filter is used. It is based on the Bayes Filter.\n",
    "The Markov process consists of a sequence of states, where each future state only depends on the current state.\n",
    "Markov Localization is particularly useful in scenarios where the environment is partially observable, and there is uncertainty in both the robot's actions and sensor measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtering is done after each segment of the global path that the robot has driven\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the header of the Markov function:\n",
    "- markov(x_robot,y_robot,x_CV,y_CV,confindence_CV,first_step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \n",
    "- belief position of the robot based on the global path (x_robot,y_robot)\n",
    "- position of the robot given by CV (x_CV,y_CV)\n",
    "- confidence of the robot's position given by CV\n",
    "- first_step: True if it the robot has just driven the first segment of the global path, False otherwise\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Implementation of the Markov filter <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"ImplementationMarkovFilter\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm consists of the following steps:\n",
    "0) Initialize the maps\n",
    "1) Belief state\n",
    "2) Sensor update\n",
    "3) Motion update\n",
    "4) Calculation step\n",
    "4) Recursive estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Decisions taken:\n",
    "- The size of the camera frame is: 480x640 - hight x width. We chose the map to have the size of 75 x 100 which has the same ratio as the camera frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "0) Initializing the maps\n",
    "This step is done once at the start of the program. To compute the Markov filter, we need three maps of the same size (75x100) \"pixels\". Please note that \"pixels\" refers to the individual squares on the map, not the camera pixels.\n",
    "The base map (map) is inisialized with a base probability of 1/(width*height) of the map.\n",
    "The map_estimate_robot and the map_estimate_CV containing the belief and measured position of the robot respecitively, are empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# map: each square has the prob = 1/(height * length)\n",

    "# map_estimate_CV: empty map with size height x length\n",
    "def initialize_maps(height,length):\n",
    "    global map, map_estimate_robot, map_estimate_CV\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # initialize map\n",
    "    initial_prob = 1/(length*height)\n",
    "    map = np.empty((height,length), float)\n",
    "    map.fill(initial_prob)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # create empty map_estimate_robot\n",
    "    map_estimate_robot = np.empty((height,length), float)\n",

    "    map_estimate_CV.fill(0.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The belief state\n",
    "In our case, the belief state corresponds to the position the robot is supposed to have after having driven a segment according to the global path. It is therefore simply equal to the current step of the global path.\n",
    "The probability that the robot is in the \"pixel\" it is supposed to be in is 0.8. The probability that it's in one of the surrounding pixels is 0.8/8 (there are 8 surrounding pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    " !!!!!!!!!!!! DID I NOT IMPLEMENT THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
    "To make sure that this also works at the edges of the map,  ??????????????????\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Sensor update\n",
    "The CV gives the position of the robot and also a confidence value. The given position has a confindence of that confidence value, the surrounding \"pixels\" have a probability of (1-confidence)/8 (there are 8 surrounding pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Calculation step\n",
    "The map, map_estimate_CV, and map_estimate_robot are multiplied and subsequently normalized so that the sum of all the elements in the map is equal to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Filtered position -> gives the correct position, if there's multiple values that have the same prob -> it takes the \"pixel\" that is closest to the position estimated by the robot\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) There is no need for a motion update as the global path is simply recalculated based on the position given by the filter after each segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Recursive estimation\n",
    "The filtering is done at every step.\n"
